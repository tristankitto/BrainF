# BRAINFUCK

Usage: python brainfuck.py <filename>

This is a simple BrainFuck interpreter which implements all of the eight commands. 
I intend to build on this and create my own modified version: BFTK.

I recommend creating an alias (or equivalent command in your CLI), for example:
```bash
> alias brainf='python "path_to_brainfuck.py"'
```
